# CodeCompanion

CodeCompanion is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app, but for developers who want to get together, talk tech, and share their knowledge. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
